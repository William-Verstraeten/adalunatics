**Skeleton of the report**

- Short introduction on harasment then zooming in on the metoo movement and then with one sentence explain what we'll be studying.
- Introduce the data used again using an image
- The goal of our research (this should be written at the end of our report (similar to an abstract in a paper))

{% include plots/PCA.html %}

------------

**Is there a gender bias in the people who talk about sexual harasment/metoo ?**

- Can we successfully separate quotes group linked to sexual harasment from the rest ?

  - Explain how we select the keywords

  - Find a nice way to show which keywords we will use

  - Show the results after manual extraction linked to keywords

  - Show the results after first LDA

  - Show the results after second LDA

- **How can we incorporate the twitter dataset in this ?**

- Study the time distribution of these quotes

- Study the gender distribution for these quotes

- Can we identify other biases (study the distribution of the metadata for the speakers)

- Is this effect also represented in the tweets ? (unfortunately can't measure, maybe we can compare with another dataset.)

---------

**Which events are responsible for the growth of the metoo movement ?**

- Over the years the #metoo movement has been marked by a few key traumatic events which lead to a sharp increase in its popularity. 
  - Show a timeline of these events 
  - Measure the impact of these events and explain how we do so
- However, other non-traumatic events have also greatly influenced the metoo movement
  - Show a second timeline
  - Measure the impact of these events too
- Compare the impact of both traumatic and non-traumatic events



-------



**Investigating cancel culture**

- Introduce cancel culture
- Explain why it is relevant for metoo
- Explain the three people we decided to study
- Show their quotes over time and do a case study explaining whether these people simply didn't find jobs or wether their jobs were silenced. (look at the wikipedia page)

----------

**Conclusion**

Something very "generalised" for example impact of non-traumatic events can show that culture can also push these kind of movements and we don't have to wait for something bad to happen to expect growth.
